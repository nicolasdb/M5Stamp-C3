## This is an example project for M5Stamp C3U on PlatformIO

Project forked to explore how to use this board.   

### This program
`main.cpp` : This code will read the state of 4 switchs and turn on/off 4 Leds.

_the picture show a DHT11 and Oled display but are not used in this example_

My goal was to test the code for a futur water level system based on float switchs.

> For ARDUINO IDE: You can copy/paste the code from `main.cpp` 
> Don't forget to install libraries.
